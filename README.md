### Hi there ~

I'm Chang Liu. I'm currently a graduate student majoring in computer graphics and game technology (CGGT) at UPenn.

My interest is rendering🖼️, both real-time and physically based. You can see a lot of stuff associated with ray tracing in my Github.



Spare time interests: guitar🎸, music🎻🎹🎸🥁🎸🎶
