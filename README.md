### Hi there ~

I'm Chang Liu. I'm currently a graduate student majoring in computer graphics and game technology (CGGT) at UPenn.

My study/professional interest is rendering🖼️, both real-time and physically based. You can see a lot of stuff associated with ray tracing in my Github.



My lifetime interests are bass🎸 and music🎻, not limited to these.
- See [This Repo](https://github.com/HummaWhite/MuseCovers) for the covers I'm making with Musescore
